**Generated:** 2026-01-14T20:30:25.548627
**Analyzer Version:** 1.0.0

## Decision Summary

**Decision:** ❌ **NO_TRADE**

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Recommendation:** DO NOT TRADE. Blocking criteria: timeline_not_impossible, timeline_feasible, no_critical_blocking_factors. Market does not meet structural tradeability requirements.

## Market Information

**Title:** Will the EU AI Act prohibited practices provision be enforced by March 2025?

**Target Date:** 2025-03-31

**Regulation:** EU AI Act

**Authority:** European Commission, National Supervisory Authorities

**Market Implied Probability:** 35.0%

## Resolution Analysis

- Binary: Yes
- Objectively Verifiable: Yes
- Source Identified: Yes
- Hard Fail: No

**Reasoning:** Resolution appears binary (matched 2 binary patterns). Verifiable source(s) identified: References EU Official Journal, References European Commission, References publication event, References official source, References specific EU Regulation. No ambiguity concerns detected. CONCLUSION: Resolution criteria pass quality check.

## Process Stage Analysis

**Current Stage:** TRANSITIONAL_PERIOD

**Remaining Stages:** 3
- DELEGATED_ACTS_PENDING
- IMPLEMENTING_ACTS_PENDING
- FULLY_APPLICABLE

**Blocking Factors:**
- Target date 2025-03-31 is before gpai_obligations application date 2025-08-02
- Target date 2025-03-31 is before main_obligations application date 2026-08-02
- Target date 2025-03-31 is before annex_i_products application date 2027-08-02
- Regulation is in transitional period - not all provisions apply yet

**Reasoning:** Analyzing Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act) as of 2026-01-14. Current stage: TRANSITIONAL_PERIOD. Remaining stages: DELEGATED_ACTS_PENDING, IMPLEMENTING_ACTS_PENDING, FULLY_APPLICABLE. BLOCKING FACTORS: Target date 2025-03-31 is before gpai_obligations application date 2025-08-02; Target date 2025-03-31 is before main_obligations application date 2026-08-02; Target date 2025-03-31 is before annex_i_products application date 2027-08-02; Regulation is in transitional period - not all provisions apply yet.

## Time Feasibility Analysis

- Days Until Target: -289
- Minimum Days Required: 0
- Feasible: No
- Hard Fail: Yes

**Institutional Constraints:**
- Target date 2025-03-31 is 289 days in the past

**Reasoning:** INVALID TIMELINE: Target date 2025-03-31 is 289 days in the past (analysis date: 2026-01-14). The market may have already resolved. Cannot analyze future feasibility for a past target date. HARD FAIL - NO TRADE.

## Probability Estimate

- Low: 0.0%
- Midpoint: 2.5%
- High: 5.0%
- Confidence: HIGH

**Assumptions:**
- Timeline is physically impossible based on minimum stage durations
- Small non-zero band accounts for theoretical edge cases

**Historical Precedents:**
- No precedent for EU regulatory process completing faster than minimum procedural requirements

**Reasoning:** HARD FAIL: Timeline impossible. Market requires completion in -289 days but minimum is 0 days. Probability range: 0-5% (effectively zero).

## Market Sanity Check

- Market Implied: 35.0%
- Our Estimate: 2.5%
- Delta: +32.5% (32.5pp)
- Direction: MARKET_TOO_HIGH
- Meets Threshold: Yes

**Reasoning:** Market-implied probability: 35.0%. Our rule-based estimate: 2.5% (confidence: HIGH). Delta: +32.5% (32.5 percentage points). Direction: MARKET_TOO_HIGH. Threshold MET: Delta (32.5pp) >= minimum required (15pp). STRONG SIGNAL: Delta exceeds strong conviction threshold. EDGE CASE WARNING: Our estimate is extreme low (2.5%) - high confidence in NO outcome
